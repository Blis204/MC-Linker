By using the Discord bot `Minecraft SMP Bot`, you agree that you have read and agreed to this policy.
This is our Privacy Policy, which will describe the types of data collected, how it is used, how to opt out of data collection, and how to remove your data.
The terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to the owner and moderators of the `Minecraft SMP Bot`. The terms "bot" and "Minecraft SMP Bot" refer to the Discord bot itself.

# PRIVACY STATEMENT
We respect the privacy of your information. This policy describes the types of information that we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our bot, as well as describing our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.
**This policy applies to any data collected through these sources:**
- Data provided directly by users
- Any commands ran

# THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
**Connections:**<br>
The Minecraft SMP Bot collects and stores Minecraft usernames that you tie to your Discord account. This will only be personally identifiable if the username is personally identifiable. 
Our bot also stores server connection files in JSON format that are tied to your Discord server. Server connections include the IP the server is running on, the Minecraft version and path to the Minecraft world folder.
These are provided voluntarily with the command `/connect` and can be removed by the user at any time. User and server connection files are stored locally on the botâ€™s server.
<br><br>**Commands:**<br>
Any command executed through our Bot are logged in the console temporarily. This includes the command name, command arguments, the tag of the user who executed the command, as well as the name of the server in which it was executed. These logs will be deleted after a restart of the Minecraft SMP Bot which usually happens every day.

# HOW WE USE INFORMATION
**Commands:**<br>
Commands are logged to help track error messages and bot abuse. When an error occurs, the command logs can be used to see the activity that occurred around the time of an error.

# OPTING OUT
How to opt out of having this data collected:
<br>**Server owners/admins:**<br>
To opt out of having any commands logged from your server, kick the Minecraft SMP Bot from your Discord server.
<br>**Server members:**<br>
To opt out of having your commands logged from a server using our bot, leave the Discord server.

# REMOVAL OF DATA
**Connections:**<br>
User and Server connections can be removed by using the implemented commands `/disconnect account`, `/disconnect ftp` or `/disconnect plugin` for the respective connections.
<br><br>**Commands:**<br>
Command logs are generally deleted every week. If you still want to urgently remove command logs, please contact me through the contacts listed at the bottom of this policy, with the Command name and User Tag of the logs you would like removed.

# THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
The Minecraft SMP Bot may link to third-party websites. These websites are separate from our bot and will have their own privacy policies. Any data collected through these third-party websites is separate and unrelated to the bot.
